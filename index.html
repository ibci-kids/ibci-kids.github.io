					<h1>Implantable Brain-Computer Interfaces (iBCI)<br />
						for Children with Complex Needs</h1>
					<p>
						We are an international collaboration of researchers, clinicians, and engineers working to
						develop implantable brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs)
						for children with complex needs. Our goal is to make sure that children who could benefit from
						iBCIs are not left behind as this technology continues
						to mature. We believe that children with complex needs deserve the same opportunities to
						communicate, learn, and play as anyone else, and are
						working to make this a reality.
